                "content": "<p>In 2009, <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/snapshot?tvwidgetsymbol=NASDAQ:NFLX\" target=\"_self\">Netflix</a> published its now-famous <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664\" target=\"_blank\">culture deck</a> online:\u00a0125 slides outlined the company's values, expected behaviors and core philosophy (&quot;people over process,&quot; in case you're interested). The document demystified the company culture, providing a behind-the-scenes glimpse into what it's like to work at the company. Facebook's COO <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-management-and-culture-presentation-2013-2\" target=\"_blank\">Sheryl Sandberg said</a> that the culture deck &quot;may well be the most important document to come out of Silicon Valley.&quot; Shortly after her proclamation, Netflix released an entire season's worth of episodes for its show <i>House of Cards</i> at once, and changed how we watch television forever, introducing us to binge-watching.</p><p><b>Related: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249174?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">10 Examples of Companies With Fantastic Cultures</a></b></p><p>Given how Netflix scaled from renting DVDs to redefining television, it would be easy to think there's something inherently magical about the culture at Netflix. There's no doubt that its culture is extremely effective. The deck does acknowledge that the culture is unusual. But, what's more fascinating is that it wasn't concocted. It was simply written down. This came out in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-netflix-built-its-company-culture/\" target=\"_blank\">recent interview</a> with Patty McCord -- the company's former chief talent officer, who co-created the document with CEO Reed Hastings. McCord said, &quot;I don't know if [the Netflix culture] was so different. Here's the most important thing we did: We just wrote it down.&quot;</p><h2><b>Don't let culture just happen.</b></h2><p>Simple as it sounds, just writing it down is something many CEOs and founders have either not considered doing or don't have the head space to really think through. Often, that's because they have not taken the time to intentionally create their culture so that it becomes their company's greatest asset. Yet <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w23255\" target=\"_blank\">a recent survey of 1,348 North American firms</a> found that more than half of their senior executives see corporate culture as one of the top three drivers of their company's value, with 92 percent of respondents saying company value would increase by improving culture. And a mere 16 percent said their culture &quot;is exactly where it should be.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>In speaking to hundreds of CEOs and founders about their company cultures, I frequently hear stories of companies that did not consciously design their culture to be a tangible asset. Instead, they let their culture evolve subconsciously and unintentionally -- into a serious liability. Not only is this a shame, it's an enormous missed opportunity. A well-defined culture can be the key to bringing employees together, standing out in your industry and scaling your business.\u00a0Further, culture isn't only an important differentiator for scaling a truly great company. It is also often the main reason a candidate chooses to join a company. As a deciding factor, culture can surpass compensation or even the inherent risk associated with the company\u00a0or role.</p><p><b>Related:\u00a0<a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322245?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">Focusing on People and Culture Helped Turn the Company I Started at Age 14 Into a Global Business</a></b></p><h2><b>Use the culture deck to clarify your culture.</b></h2><p>To the many founders and CEOs wrestling with the question of when to address culture, my answer is, do it now. In my 17 years of working with high-growth startups, I've found that every company has a culture, deliberately and intentionally created or not. One good strategy is to use the process of creating your culture deck to get started.</p><p>A strong, well-designed culture deck becomes an extremely effective tool in communicating exactly how the company operates, giving the people insight into the company's mission, values, vision and purpose. It differentiates the business from the competition and can help attract, recruit and retain A-plus\u00a0talent. A good deck will explain in detail the kind of behavior that will get someone hired, promoted or fired. It can illuminate how employees can make a difference and fulfill their potential, and it will answer the fundamental questions that potential employees may have about how the business operates.</p><p><b>Related:\u00a0<a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322424?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">Inside Netflix's Notorious Firing Practices</a></b></p><h2><b>Look beyond Netflix for examples.</b></h2><p>In creating your company's culture deck, you can, of course, turn to the Netflix culture deck for inspiration. But, look beyond that as well -- at the culture decks and documents of other businesses with world-class cultures, such as Asana, Hubspot and <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/linkedin?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">LinkedIn</a>. (Full disclosure: I gathered these and more in my <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brettonputter.com/culture-decks-decoded-book\" target=\"_blank\">recent book</a> in order to provide companies with a clear research tool and blueprints.) The process is invaluable, and a way to determine what is unique to <i>your</i> company as opposed to these other organizations.</p><p>For startup founders, clearly defining your culture can help you create a scaled, sustainable business. Culture plays a critical role in the eventual success or floundering of a business, and a company's fate can often be directly linked back to its values and cultural norms. Defining those values and norms, and then encoding into a culture deck is an absolute must for any company wanting to thrive in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/what-vuca-really-means-for-you\" target=\"_blank\">VUCA economy</a>. Not only is culture about intentionally creating the environment and experience of your employees and the value you want to provide your customers, it also directly impacts revenue and profitability. If you want your company to win the so-called &quot;war for talent,&quot; and if you're going to create a company where the culture is an asset and not a liability, then you need a culture deck.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323475?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">Why Every Business Needs a Culture Deck -- And How to Create One</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322302?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">4 Reasons Why Empathy Is Good for Business</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321121?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">The 6 Levels of the Hero Factor</a><br></p>",

It seems like the Power will assume the role that the Moto Play usually holds as the big battery model, containing a 5,000mAh battery. </p>\n<p>For comparison, our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17562162/moto-g6-play-plus-review-2018-budget-phones-motorola\">review of the Moto G6 Play</a> found that its 4,000mAh battery was able to last around three days with moderate use.</p>\n<p>The Moto G7 Power may not actually be that powerful, though. There are rumors from <em>XDA Developers</em> that the phone will have lower specs than the standard G7. The G7 Power might run on a Snapdragon 632 processor like the lower-end G7 Play. It\ also been rumored that the G7 Power model will be available in four models varying from 2GB to 6GB of RAM, and 32GB to 64GB of storage.</p>\n<p>Not much else is known about the Moto G7 Power, except that the phone dimensions will be slightly wider and taller than the other devices in the G7 lineup to accommodate for the larger battery.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iUeEgCUKaVgne8v53v_7_ORmCBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13589598/Motorola_Moto_G7_Power_Diagram.png\">\n<cite>Image: FCC</cite>\n</figure>",

The Nintendo Creators Program is coming to a close at the end of December.

The 13-episode series is being directed by Shinji Aramaki, who directed the <em>Appleseed </em>films, and Kenji Kamiyama, who directed the <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em> series. Additionally, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> director Shinichir\u014d Watanabe is acting as <em>Black Lotus</em>\ creative producer.</p>\n<p>The creative companies aren\ yet releasing information on what the series will be about, but a press release says it will include some existing <em>Blade Runner</em> characters, and that it takes place in 2032. This sets it 17 years before <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, and 10 years after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16368302/blade-runner-2049-anime-cowboy-bebop-shinichiro-watanabe\"><em>Blade Runner: Black Out 2022</em></a><em>, </em>the 15-minute prequel anime episode to <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> that Watanabe directed. Aramaki also worked on <em>2022</em> as the mechanical designer, as did Sola Digital Arts, which did the computer graphics for the prequel episode. That company will be animating the new series.</p>\n<p>There is no set release date for the series. Production will reportedly begin once Aramaki and Kamiyama are finished directing their reboot of the <em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em> series, which was announced in 2017. When <em>Blade Runner \ Black Lotus </em>does air, it\ be shown with an English dub during Adult Swim\ Toonami programming block, and it will be subtitled on Crunchyroll\ streaming service.</p>",

Series that are ordered, which include a few with Hollywood star talent attached, will be available to all YouTube users for free, regardless of whether they\ signed up for YouTube Premium. In the past, pilot episodes were free to watch, but users had to pay a monthly $12 fee to watch the entire series. </p>\n<p>Robert Kyncl, YouTube\ chief business officer, told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the company learned through experimentation that \ lot of the projects work incredibly well\ when they\ made available for free through ad-supported networks. It\ a different approach than what YouTube\ team originally wanted to do. </p>\n<p>\ you look at our originals over the last few years, our main goal was to drive subscribers to YouTube Premium,\ Kyncl said.</p>\n<h2><strong>A fork in the road</strong></h2>\n<p>That original approach didn\ work out the way the company hoped. Although YouTube hasn\ released the exact number of subscribers YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) has, the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music\">reportedly only registered 1.5 million subscribers in 2016</a>. The paid tier didn\ exactly deliver on the promise of more prestigious, exclusive programming for users. The shows were limited, they didn\ receive great critical feedback, and, perhaps most importantly, it appeared that YouTube\ team ran into trouble transitioning people who were used to a free platform into paid content. </p>\n<p>All of these elements led YouTube to a fork in the road: it could pursue original series more aggressively and hope for more subscribers, or it could scale back. Instead, YouTube found an alternative. The company invested hundreds of millions of dollars into expanding YouTube Premium (then Red), teaming up with celebrities like Kevin Hart and Ellen DeGeneres for original series. Although the paywall still existed, YouTube explored releasing many of these series for free to all YouTube users. The new series relied heavily on ad support and sponsorships. The concept was simple: big names will attract big advertisers, and that means more money in YouTube\ pocket. </p>\n<p>As a result, subscriptions became less important as YouTube expanded its ad-supported network of original series. It\ something that other companies that work with YouTube noticed, too. An <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/neither-hulu-netflix-spotify-youtube-red-identity-crisis/\">executive told Digiday</a> that YouTube Red subscriptions made up \ than one percent\ of revenue for major channels. </p>\n<blockquote><p>One executive at a network that gets more than a billion views per month on YouTube said YouTube Red subscription revenue accounted for about 7 percent of the network\ \-monetized\ revenue in 2017. \\ with just what YouTube monetizes and doesn\ include [the ads and sponsorships] that we sell,\ he said. \ you add in what we sell, it becomes less than a percent.\</p></blockquote>\n<p>YouTube continued to expand its library, relying heavily on ad support from big-name companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, which signed on for a Ryan Seacrest-led show. But no one, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/13/17007786/susan-wojcicki-youtube-red-music-originals-smosh-hank-green-poppy\">not even YouTube</a>, could quite agree on what YouTube Red <em>was</em>, especially in a sea of rapidly growing original content from Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. The company showed no signs of slowing down, and it felt pressure to compete, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-04/with-40-new-original-shows-youtube-targets-tv-s-breadbasket\">according to a 2017 article from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. More shows were added, more celebrities were chased, and more advertisements were secured. </p>\n<p>Considering how invested YouTube seemed in original series at the time, news of the company\ decision to scale back may seem out of the blue, but executives like CEO Susan Wojcicki have hinted at this direction for some time. </p>\n<h2><strong>This was coming</strong></h2>\n<p>Then, in February, Wojcicki made headlines <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/2/9/16996958/how-to-watch-live-stream-youtube-ceo-susan-wojcicki-code-media\">after telling <em>Recode</em>\ Kara Swisher</a> that YouTube Premium was a music service. It marked the first time that a YouTube executive specifically called out the subscription platform as a music service, putting the emphasis on the platform\ video library through its partnership with Vevo. </p>\n<p>\ goal is to be a large, leading video platform and have a large diverse set of content,\ Wojcicki told Swisher. \ are all these categories that no one is really providing a solution to, and we can be best at breeding there. Shows and movies is a very competitive space; it needs to be paid for economically with a subscription service.\</p>\n<p>When asked if YouTube was interested in developing a series that could compete against a prestige original show from Netflix or Hulu in the same vein as <em>House of Cards</em>, Wojcicki offered another insightful answer into what the company\ plans were.</p>\n<p>\ could, but I\ not sure that would further what we\ trying to do at YouTube,\ she said.</p>\n<p>This was a stark 180-degree pivot away from where the company\ plans were two years prior. Susanne Daniels, the former head of MTV\ original content who oversees YouTube Premium, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/6/12393710/youtube-pewdiepie-ron-howard-red\">told reporters in 2016</a> the exact opposite. </p>\n<p>\ is all in on original content,\ Daniels said. \ want to open Hollywood\ rolodex and introduce our creators to visionary directors, writers, and producers.\</p>\n<p>It\ a short period for a massive shift in winds. A few things happened that can help explain YouTube\ reluctance to pursue more original series \ especially with individual creators who have huge followings on YouTube. </p>\n<p>Part of YouTube\ plan with original series was to attract bigger advertisers, but in the wake of multiple controversies \ including disturbing children\ content, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and terrorist content appearing with ads on the platform \ companies became reluctant to place ads on YouTube videos. YouTube couldn\ promise safety, and that was a big concern for advertisers. </p>\n<p>Then, YouTube ran into issues with individual creators. Felix \\ Kjellberg lost his original series <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/30/9646024/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-youtube-red-ad-blocking\"><em>Scare PewDiePie</em></a><em> </em>in February 2017,<em> </em>following <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/16/14641340/pewdiepie-anti-semitic-videos-youtube\">controversy over anti-Semitic jokes</a> and images that appeared in his videos. Logan Paul\ original movie <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16871562/logan-paul-youtube-red-thinning\"><em>The Thi</em></a><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013664/logan-paul-the-thinning-new-world-order-movie-youtube-review\"><em>n</em></a><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16871562/logan-paul-youtube-red-thinning\"><em>ning: New World Order</em></a> was put on hold after he filmed a dead body in Japan\ Aokigahara forest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy\">earlier this year</a>. (Paul\ film was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988706/logan-paul-movie-youtube-premium-thinning-new-world-order-suicide-forest-controversy\">unceremoniously released</a> last month.) Both creators were working with YouTube on the projects and earning top-tier Google Preferred ad income. The company was facing major issues. Suddenly, its top stars were becoming controversial faces, and advertisers didn\ want their ads appearing on the videos or sponsoring those creators. </p>\n<p>YouTube execs may have launched YouTube Red with the intention of being a genuine Netflix competitor and honing its own talent for original series, but suddenly, it had become too risky of a bet. People weren\ really subscribing, advertisers were concerned about the platform, and creators were no longer reliable. So YouTube pivoted to a safer bet that it could expand upon: music and celebrities. </p>\n<h2><strong>What\ next?</strong></h2>\n<p>If that trajectory sounds familiar, it\ because it\ the same one that <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/7/17319966/youtube-creators-demonetization-advertising-philip-defranco-logan-paul-pewdiepie-casey-neistat\">defined MTV for years</a>. </p>\n<p>The future of YouTube Premium is unclear, but one thing is certain: it\ not going to rely on subscriptions. The company is instead returning to its roots and investing star power there. Advertisements will appear before videos, and everything will be free. But in order to maintain top-dollar advertisement placements from big companies, celebrities will be roped in. That\ why <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/victoria-beckham-is-launching-a-youtube-channel-1164061\">Victoria Beckham has a YouTube channel</a>, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17886896/will-smith-vlog-youtube-channel-yes-theory-bungee-jump-helicoptor-helibungee\">Will Smith</a> and Ellen DeGeneres. </p>\n<p>Now, YouTube Premium isn\ as worthwhile for users; other than offline music play and ad-free viewing, subscribers aren\ going to get much out of it. But to the company, that doesn\ matter. Subscriptions aren\ what YouTube is interested in \ advertisements and celebrity channels are. As more celebrities are brought in, both to help boost the platform\ credibility within the industry and to secure better advertisements, YouTube\ landscape is going to change. </p>\n<p>What was once a possible purchase for those who might have been interested in YouTube\ original content that was hidden behind a membership fee suddenly seems like an inexplicable buy. </p>",

The fancy name for this is \\,)</em></p><p><strong>You shared thoughts such\u00a0as:</strong></p><ul><li>I follow people that inspire me. They have something I aspire to, or at least would like to aspire. I have a greater respect to these persons than usual and I know for a fact that they are very good at _that_ of which my inspiration derives.</li><li>I follow much of the philosophy that I saw from my previous tech manager. I knew that he was an extremely good software engineer and in terms of leadership he lead by example and never let someone else took a bullet than him. He protected the team and at the same time empowered us.</li><li>I trust that my boss has my\u00a0back.</li><li>They have their own opinion and are honest with others. I follow when someone makes sense to me, even if that\ not 100% of the\u00a0time.</li><li>I need the paycheck, so I must do what they\u00a0say.</li></ul><blockquote>After doing more reading, thinking, and me-search, I\ formed a working Theory of Followership.</blockquote><h3>My theory is that people actively follow based on the following factors.</h3><p>1. Trust/Relationship\\\ feel a positive relationship toward the leader.<br>2. Competence\\\ feel the leader is competent.<br>3. Vision/Purpose\\\ feel the leader is going in a \\ direction.<br>4. Admiration\\\ feel the leader has positive qualities, which they wish to possess.<br>5. Environment\\\ environment reinforces followership activities.</p><h3><strong>A Hypothesis to test the\u00a0theory</strong></h3><p>First, consider each factor on a scale from -5 to\u00a0+5.</p><p>Now, let me offer a hypothesis:</p><blockquote><strong>To achieve <em>active</em> followership at least 2 factors must score greater than +3, as long as the other factors aren\ below\u00a0zero.</strong></blockquote><p>For example, I\ had a boss who I enthusiastically followed who scored this way:<br>1.Trust/Relationship: +3<br>2. Competence: +5<br>3. Vision/Purpose: 0<br>4. Admiration: +1<br>5. Environment: +1</p><p>I\ had another boss who I struggled to follow, because at least one factor was below 0:<br>1. Trust/Relationship: +3<br>2. Competence: -2<br>3. Vision/Purpose: +3<br>4. Admiration: -1<br>5. Environment: +2</p><p>Even though we had a good relationship (+3), a shared purpose (+3), I didn\ feel they were competent (-2) in their current role, and I didn\ really admire them\u00a0(-1).</p><blockquote>No matter how high some factors are, the more factors come in below zero, the less we actively\u00a0follow.</blockquote><p>Finally, I had a boss who I couldn\ stand, but followed anyhow, that scored like this:<br>1. Trust/Relationship: -1<br>2. Competence: -2<br>3. Vision/Purpose: +2<br>4. Admiration: 0<br>5. Environment: +5</p><p>This was a job that I had to have to pay the bills, or my kids would be on the street. I did somewhat believe in the work, but truthfully, I was there for the\u00a0money.</p><p>I don\ think I really \\ him, but I did what he told me to so I wouldn\ get fired. Maybe we could call that \ followership\ (or \ march\).\u00a0&lt;grin></p><h3>Notice a\u00a0pattern?</h3><p>Each factor is subjective, and we\ scoring from the perspective of the follower, not the\u00a0leader.</p><p>This means what\ important is not how leaders <strong>try</strong> to be perceived, but how they are <strong>actually</strong> perceived by their\u00a0team.</p><p>As Virginia Satir wisely said, <em>\ can\ see your own back, but everyone else\u00a0can.\</em></p><blockquote>The only score that matters is the one that followers give you. You\ got to find a way to get information from them, and then create a feedback loop for improvement.</blockquote><p><strong>DO try this at home</strong><br>Take a step beyond me-search and take a few minutes to rank someone <strong>above </strong>you on the scale presented above.</p><ul><li>What factors do you feel impact you the\u00a0most?</li><li>How would you change my Theory of Followership to fit you\u00a0better?</li><li>Extra credit for asking someone on your team to rank you on this scale, and then having a discussion about\u00a0it.</li></ul><p>I\ love to hear how this went.

                "content": "<p>There was male/female discord in the workplace well before the #MeToo movement. But, if the #MeToo movement has taught me anything, it's that we need men to be part of this conversation. We cannot isolate ourselves from men and expect to change the status quo. Women are instinctively more collaborative in their approach to business. So, instead of looking at business as a place to compete with each other, we need to work together to empower women in the workplace, in politics\u00a0and in the overall economy. Being pro-women doesn't mean one must be anti-men. So, why perpetuate the cycle?</p><p><b>Related:\u00a0<a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323589?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">Men: Be the Hero</a></b></p><p>Improving relations between men and women is key to increasing opportunities for women in business. A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hrdive.com/news/poll-women-and-men-uneasy-being-alone-together-for-business-meetings/446300/\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> released last year by Morning Consult, a tech and media company, found that a portion of men and women are uncomfortable with one-on-one business meetings with members of the opposite sex. And in fact, one quarter of those surveyed said they actually disapproved of these meetings.</p><p>Unfortunately, men still hold a lot of the keys in the business realm. But, their experience means that we can learn a lot from them. Segregating people by gender eliminates opportunities for women to gain valuable knowledge. Instead, we should be focused on working with men to change the way they look at gender equality issues.</p><p>Last year, consulting firm McKinsey &amp;\u00a0Company released Women in the Workplace 2017, a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://womenintheworkplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> that looked at how opinions between women and men differ. The report was the result of a survey of more than 70,000 employees working at 76 companies. Overall, it found that 63 percent of men and 49 percent of women believe their company is doing what it takes to improve gender diversity. Fifty-five percent of men said disrespectful behavior in their workplaces is addressed quickly, but only 34 percent of women agreed. Half of the men surveyed said their companies consider diverse candidates for open jobs, compared to only 35 percent of women.</p><p><b>Related:\u00a0<a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323283?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">How to Address Gender Inequity at Work</a></b></p>While not entirely surprising, the survey revealed other differences of opinion as well. For example, in those companies where just one in 10 senior leaders is female, nearly 50 percent of men said women were &quot;well represented&quot; in the senior ranks, but only one-third of women agreed. Only 47 percent of men said gender diversity was a very important or top personal priority for them.<p>But, regardless of what the men surveyed believe, the McKinsey report demonstrates that disparities do exist. According to the report, women are 18 percent less likely to be promoted than their male peers when it comes to the first critical step up to manager. Additionally, the report indicates &quot;women are less likely to receive advice from managers and senior leaders on how to advance, and employees who do are more likely to say they've been promoted in the last two years.&quot;</p><h2><b>So, what can we do about it?</b></h2><p>Instead of excluding men, we can support the men who want to support women. First, we need to have safe places for open dialogue. We need to understand how each gender is feeling and address our concerns with a focus on solutions, not finger pointing. While there are going to be bad seeds (both male and female) in every company, by starting with the assumption that everyone wants equal opportunity for women, you can create a collaborative environment for enacting change.</p><p>For companies, start by conducting a pay audit. Cold, hard numbers can be a great starting point for admitting that there is an issue and getting buy-in to change company culture. Review and analyze compensation by gender and don't hide the numbers. Create transparency to build trust from the women in your company that you will work toward equal pay and opportunities for women.</p><p><b>Related:\u00a0<a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/320383?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_self\">How to Get Male Venture Capitalists to Invest in Your Female-Targeted Product</a></b></p><p>Finally, look inward. Embracing your own personal power will help you take risks, have uncomfortable conversations, ask for that promotion or raise, take the lead on a high profile project\u00a0or start your own business. Going fearlessly after what you deserve is an important component to making progress for women, as well as putting you on the path to personal success.</p><p>Women are shifting the paradigm. The traditional pillars of business, which prize competition, getting ahead at all costs, and looking out for number one were built by men. These are all outdated business theories and we're introducing a different mindset. As the Dalai Lama said, &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businessworld.in/article/Are-Women-More-Powerful-Than-Men-/06-03-2018-142417/\" target=\"_blank\">The world will be saved by the western woman</a>,&quot; but we need the men in our lives to be part of that movement, too. It's impossible for women to advance if men aren't a part of their journey. And if men don't play a major role in revolutionizing the business world as a whole, real change won't be possible.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323182?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">Why Excluding Men Is Not the Path to Promoting Women</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323589?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">Men: Be the Hero</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/320719?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">The Gender Wage Gap Inspires More Women to Create Their Own Paycheck</a><br></p>",

It was easy and painless \ from a $14,000 salary to six figures.</p><p>But that\ the marketing story, the one that gets attention, the one that all the entrepreneur coaches tell you to say. But it\ not the true story of my <i>why</i>. This is.</p><p>My dad had a stroke when I was 14 years old. That was the day my childhood came to an abrupt end. It was the day I learned the valuable lesson that many entrepreneurs take for granted. It would become the day that shaped my journey.</p><h2><b>From funeral director to entrepreneur. </b></h2><p>My dad\ stroke came out of nowhere. He was a healthy 45-year-old who swam daily, ate right, and worked hard. Just three years before, he quit his job as a funeral director to pursue his entrepreneurial dream.\u00a0</p><p>My father had poured his heart and soul into funeral directing for nearly two decades. He was often the only bright spot for families experiencing tragic loss. But the emotions that came with watching parents bury their children and families say goodbye to loved ones weighed on him.</p><p>While the job was difficult, my dad was making a difference, and that was important to him. Even when he quit his job, he didn\ do it to avoid grief-stricken families. He quit to make a different kind of impact \ to help people create a financially secure future.\u00a0</p><p>My dad built his financial planning company from the ground up. In just three years, he earned more than 30 clients. Life changed for the better. He was happier, and our financial situation was stronger than ever. My parents even took my two brothers and me on a week-long cruise to Alaska, which we could never have afforded before. Unfortunately, the good times didn\ last.</p><h2><b>The stroke.</b></h2><p>I remember where I was when it happened. I was playing Nintendo GameCube in the living room when my dad returned home from work. Usually, we\ have dinner and watch TV as a family. This time was different.</p><p>He stumbled into the house and exclaimed, \ need to go to the hospital right now. I can\ feel the left half of my body.\ Those words seemed so foreign to me. I\ never heard my dad talk about pain before.</p><p>The next 30 to 60 minutes were a blur. I can\ recall the details but remember the emotions: sheer and utter terror, and a feeling of impending loss. I remember the silent ride to the hospital. We were all too shocked to say anything.</p><p>I don\ recall watching my dad get rushed away. The next thing I remember was the doctor explaining that my dad had an aneurysm. I was dumbfounded and terrified. Would my father live? If he did, would he be the same?</p><h2><b>Security to uncertainty.</b></h2><p>My dad\ company was the last thing on our minds. We just hoped he would make it home. Thankfully he did, and that's what mattered.</p><p>But here\ the thing: My dad\ business had a massive bottleneck \ <i>himself.</i></p><p>Suddenly, his clients had no financial advisor or backup. His only support was an assistant. He didn\ expect to get sick, so had no systems or processes to delegate to someone else. Without them, it was only a matter of time before something exploded. No one could have expected it would be my dad\ brain.</p><p>As if seeing my real-life Superman near death wasn\ hard enough for a 14-year-old, the stroke\ repercussions were cataclysmic. When he went down, so did the business.</p><h2><b>Imprisoned by entrepreneurship. </b></h2><p>The next few years were tumultuous. My dad was a fighter, but the medical bills escalated as more complications arose. He started taking Ambien because he couldn\ sleep. The medication caused him to drive in his sleep, and he needed surgery after he was in an accident as a result. At one point, we hired a full-time nurse to care for him because he contracted an infection.</p><p>He lost his clients, one by one. They couldn\ put their finances on hold, and we had no one on call to help. Entrepreneurship was meant to give our family freedom, but it imprisoned us instead. One of my older brothers left college to help with the business \ but he couldn\. My dad had no systems and kept everything in his head, and the doctors told us not to stress him with work.</p><p>Our lifestyle changed drastically. Suddenly, going to private school was in jeopardy. We lost the house I was raised in, and my mom had to return to work. I wished things could go back to the way they were, even if that meant my dad was a funeral director again.</p><p>In the end, we made it through the tough times because my dad didn\ give up, and neither did we. I graduated from college, and my dad eventually got back on his feet. He went back to his company, this time with a team, systems, and processes. Now his business is stronger than ever. He teaches seminars and even wrote a best-selling book on financial planning.</p><h2><b>Your business isn\ just <i>you</i>.</b></h2><p>I blacked out the memory of this time for years because it was too difficult. But my dad persevered and inspired me. I became an entrepreneur and am now the CEO of a marketing and consulting firm. I also learned the importance of future-proofing your business.</p><p>When I created my coaching business, I didn\ do it to help other entrepreneurs avoid my dad\ pitfalls. That was my subconscious motivation, but I was scared to make it a reality. I no longer have that fear, but it took me over two years to get here.</p><p>My first mentors helped me understand that this wasn\ just my dad\ story, but mine too. I slowly began to share it with clients. When I realized how this story could change lives, I knew I had to embrace it as my own. If it helps others avoid the struggles my family experienced, then it\ worth sharing.</p><p>Today, this is my life\ mission: to help entrepreneurs develop systems that remove them as the key drivers of their business. That starts with creating a strategy. Establish and document what you do and how, including a process for prospecting, sales, and servicing clients. With repeatable systems, you can hire others to execute parts of the process outside your zone of genius. If you get sick or take a vacation, your systems and teams can continue without you.</p><p>My dad thought he\ have time to get this right later. But when you need these systems, it\ too late to create them \ whether it\ because you\ sick or simply too busy. You have to address the need before you <i>actually </i>need it.</p><p>Life and entrepreneurship is an amazing journey, but you have less control than you think. We don\ know what will happen tomorrow, so security matters. Once you have it, you can take on the world. You can also live stress-free \ for yourself and your family.</p><p><b><i>Connect with Alex on </i></b><b><i><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://facebook.com/schlinsky\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p><strong>Related:</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323565?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">What My Dad's Near-Death Experience Taught Me About Business</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323696?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">Five Tips for Entrepreneurs Relocating with Their Families</a><br><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/322193?utm_source=Feedly&utm_medium=related&utm_campaign=syndication\">When Her Mother Was Diagnosed With Breast Cancer, She Started a Popcorn Company to Raise Money for Research</a><br></p>",
